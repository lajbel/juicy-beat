# Juicy Beat!

Hey! This is an early access version of Juicy Beat, a cutting apples rhythm
game. Juicy Beat offers playing Turkish March while using a giant sword for
cutting apples and making score!

It was made using KAPLAY. For charting it's using TJA (Taikojiro Sound Map), so
yeah, it's basically a Taiko with three buttons. I hope you enjoy it.
