# Juicy Beat!

Hey! This is an early access version of **Juicy Beat!**, a cutting apples rhythm
game. **Juicy Beat!** offers playing different songs while using a giant sword
for cutting apples and making score!

- **LEFT, UP, RIGHT*** - Hit notes
- **A** (in song selection) - Activate AUTO MODE for a song

<!--only github reade, remove otherwise -->

![](./promo/beats.gif) \*WASD also avaible

It was made using KAPLAY. For charting it's using TJA (Taikojiro Sound Map), so
yeah, it's basically a Taiko with three buttons. I hope you enjoy it.
